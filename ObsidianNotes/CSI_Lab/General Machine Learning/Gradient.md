The Gradient of a multivariate function f(x, y) is the vector field that maps the input to the vector associated with the path of steepest ascent. 
$$ \nabla f = <\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}>$$

In 3-axis cartesian coordinates, the gradient can be represented as:

$$ 
\nabla f = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\hat{i}  + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\hat{j} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial z}\hat{k}
$$
**Note:** To get the direction of steepest *descent*, you can just take the negative gradient $-\nabla f$.
