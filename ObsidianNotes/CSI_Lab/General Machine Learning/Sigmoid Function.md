The **Sigmoid** (or logistic) function is a common function that is typically used as an [[Activation Function]] in a [[Neural Network]]. 
A standard logistic function can be used within a [[Neural Network]] to introduce nonlinearity in the model or to clamp signals to within a specified interval. 

The Sigmoid function can be defined as:
$$
\sigma = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}} = \frac{e^x}{1+e^x}
$$
