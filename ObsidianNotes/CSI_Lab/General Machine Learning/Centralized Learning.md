In Centralized Learning, a [[Machine Learning Model]] is trained using large datasets stored in a centralized server. This is in contrast to decentralized [[Federated Learning]], where the data is distributed over a large number of clients. 

Centralized Learning (aka server model) does not require the client data to be transmitted over the network, which ensures privacy.
