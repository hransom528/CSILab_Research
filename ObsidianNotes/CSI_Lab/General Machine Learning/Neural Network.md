A Neural Network (NN) is a type of [[Machine Learning Model]] that uses an architecture inspired by how neurons interact with each other to solve a nonlinear optimization problem. 

Each neural network is made up of several **layers**. Each layer includes many **nodes** that connect to nodes of other layers. 

Every neural network has an **input layer** (the layer where embedded data is fed into the model) and an **output layer** (the layer where the model outputs its results). Every layer in between these two layers is called a **hidden layer**.
