**Directed graphs** are a specific subset of [[Graphs]] in which an [[Edge]] $(u, v) \in \mathbf{E}$ is *unidirectional*, in that an edge from node *u* to node *v* does not mean that there exists an edge from node *v* to node *u*. 

Directed graphs are typically represented with arrows at the end of edges to denote their directionality.
