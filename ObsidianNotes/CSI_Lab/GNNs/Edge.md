An **edge**, in the context of [[Graphs]], is a connection between two [[Node]]s, represented in an [[Adjacency Matrix]]. 

An individual edge between node *u* and node *v* can be denoted as:
$$
(u, v) \in \mathbf{E}
$$
When we are discussing an [[Undirected Graph]], an edge from node *u* to node *v* also implies an edge from node *v* to node *u* such that:
$$
(u, v) \in \mathbf{E} \leftrightarrow (v, u) \in \mathbf{E}
$$
