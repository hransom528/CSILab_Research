**Undirected graphs** are a subset of [[Graphs]] in which an [[Edge]] $(u, v) \in \mathbf{E}$ is *undirected*, such that an edge that goes from node *u* to node *v* also means that there is an edge that goes from node *v* to node *u*. 

Undirected graphs are typically represented with straight unterminated line segments for their edges.
